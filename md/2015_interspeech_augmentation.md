# Audio Augmentation for Speech Recognition
## Abstract
- Data Augmentation is a common strategy adopted to increase the quantity of training data, avoid overfitting and improve robustness of the models.
- The method we particularly recommend is to change the speed of the audio signal, producing 3 versions of the original signal with speed factors of 0.9, 1.0 and 1.1.
## Introduction
- VTLP
- Add Noise
## Audio perturbation
- Speed perturbation
- When the speed of the signal is reduced, there is a shift in the signal energy towards lower frequencies.
