## Abstract
- Tiem Delay Neural Network(TDNNs), also known as one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network(1-d CNNs), are efficient and well-performing neural network architecture for speech recognition.
## Introduction
- The most popular method to reduce the number of parameters of already-trained neural networks is to use `Singular Value Decomposition(SVD)` to factorize each learned weight matrix as a product of two much smaller factors, discarding the smaller singular values. In those cases the network parameters are fine-tuned after this.
## Training with semi-orthogonal constraint
- TODO
