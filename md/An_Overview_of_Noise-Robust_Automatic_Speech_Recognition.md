# An_Overview_of_Noise-Robust_Automatic_Speech_Recognition
## Abstract
- New waves of consumer-centric applications, such as voice search and voice interaction with mobile devices and home entertainment systems, increasing require automatic speech recognition (ASR) to be robust to the full range of real-world noise and other acoustic distoring conditions.
## The background and scope
- 冲击响应时间 vs. DFT窗长
- Removing **phase** term achieving simplicity in developing speech enhancement algorithms, but with the time, removing it is a partial cause of the degradation of enhancement performance at low SRNs.
- Modeling Distrotions of Speech in Acooustic Environments
    - Given the unsatisfactory behavior of multi-style training, it is necessary to work on technologies that directly deal with the noise and channel impacts.
