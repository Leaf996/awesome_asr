# Modular Construction of Time-Delay Neural Networks for Speech Recognition
## Abstract
- The two major areas of concern are the problem of the time and the problem of scaling. The problem of time is addressed by the development of a `Time-Delay Neural Network`, the problem of scaling by `Modularity and Incremental Design` of large nets based on smaller subcomponent nets.
## Introduction
- Numerous studies have recently demonstrated powerful pattern recognition capabilities emerging from **connectionist models** of **artificial neural network**.
## Temporal Processing
- One problem in speech recognition is the problem of time.
- Another consequence of the dynamic nature of speech is the general absence of any unambiguous (清楚的) acoustic cue that indicates when a particular sond occurs.
