# A Comparison of lattice-free discriminative training criteria for purely sequence-trained neural network acoustic models
## Question
- LF-MMI can train from scratch without CE pre-training ?
## Key Concepts
- Sequence discriminative training
- **MMI** : Maximum mutual information
- **bMMI** : Boosted maximum mutual information
- **sMBR** : State-level minimum Bayes risk
## Knowledge
- Discriminative training of a NN is typically initialized from a frame-level cross-entropy pre-trained model which is also used to generate alignments and lattices
