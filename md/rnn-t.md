## Sequence Transduction with Recurrent Neural Networks
### Question
- TODO


### Key Concepts
- **First Blood(2012)**
- **variable length**
- robust to sequences distortions
- transduction(transforme input sequences into output sequences)
- CTC


### Application
- handwriting recognition
- text generation
- language model
