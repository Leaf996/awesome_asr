## streaming_end_to_end_speech_recognition_for_mobile_devices
### Question
- How to understand U+T ?
- How to process data ?
- Pretrain is MUST ?


### Key Concepts
- streaming fashion
- real time
- robust to the long tail of use cases
- **leverage use-specific context**
- extremely accurate
- advantage
    - reliability
    - latency
    - privacy
- challenges
    - accurate with low latency
    - leverage on-device user context
    - **long tail** of possible utterances
- rnn-t
    - forward-backward
